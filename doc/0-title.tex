\section*{Abstract}

The project \textit{Suicide Rates} aims at answering the question, whether or not there is a correlation between the GDP\footnote{Gross Domestic Product} per capita and the number of suicides in a country. The underlying data sets not only contains yearly GDP and suicide rate data, but also breaks down the suicide rate by generation and sex, and further provides the HDI\footnote{Human Development Index} and population size of the respective year, which makes it possible to correlate suicide rates to other socio-economic parameters as well.
