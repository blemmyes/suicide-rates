\section{Data}

The underlying data (see \texttt{master.csv}) set has been provided by Kaggle\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016/download}} and provides data on suicide rates of 102 countries\footnote{\texttt{cut -d, -f1 master.csv | sort | uniq | wc -l}} from 1985 to 2016.

Figure \imgref{fig:available-data} shows the data set is all but complete. Some countries have very few data points, whereas others have data for most of the years. The less yearly data is available, the harder an assessment of the development for a single country becomes.
